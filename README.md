# ANDigital DevOps Test

The purpose of this test is for you to showcase your ability to create a pipeline to build and run the code in this repository, there are 3 main steps that we would like to see:
 - pulling the code from this repository
 - creating some sort of build and deployment process
 - having this code running on a server somewhere

The build steps for this code are as follows

Install Node Dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

Run Gulp with either:
```
$ gulp
or
$ npm run postinstall
```

Start the NodeJS application:
```
$ npm start
```


## A written solution although acceptable is less preferable than a working solution.
